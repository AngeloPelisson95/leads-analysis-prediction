# Notebooks Directory

This directory contains Jupyter notebooks for the Lead Generation Vehicle Listings analysis, organized by purpose:

## Structure
- `exploratory/`: Notebooks for data exploration, lead analysis, and visualization
- `modeling/`: Notebooks for predictive model development, training, and evaluation

## Guidelines
- Use descriptive names with prefixes (e.g., `01_data_exploration.ipynb`)
- Include a brief description at the top of each notebook
- Clear the output before committing to version control
- Use markdown cells to document your thought process

## Current Notebooks
- `exploratory/case_parte_1.ipynb`: Initial vehicle data exploration and lead analysis
- `exploratory/case_desafio_bonus.ipynb`: Bonus challenge - advanced lead optimization analysis
- `modeling/case_parte_2.ipynb`: Predictive model development for lead generation
