# 🚗 Lead Generation Prediction for Vehicle Listings

## 🎯 Project Overview
This machine learning project predicts the number of leads generated by vehicle advertisements using advanced feature engineering and gradient boosting algorithms. The solution helps automotive businesses optimize their listing strategies and maximize customer engagement through data-driven insights.

**Main Goal**: Predict the number of leads (customer inquiries) that a vehicle listing will generate based on vehicle characteristics, pricing, location, and advertisement features. The model works for advertisements already posted on website, not for new advertises. The possible leads of an advertise can be predicted after any update.

## 🏆 Model Performance & Results

### **Key Achievements**
- **📊 Model Accuracy**: RMSE = 6.922 leads, R² = 70.3%
- **📈 Performance Improvement**: 64.6% better than baseline prediction
- **⚡ Processing Speed**: <1ms prediction time per listing
- **📋 Feature Optimization**: Reduced from 48 to 16 features while maintaining accuracy

### **Model Specifications**
- **Algorithm**: LightGBM Regressor with hyperparameter optimization
- **Training Data**: 48,578 vehicle listings
- **Validation**: 5-fold cross-validation with overfitting detection
- **Feature Engineering**: Target encoding, flag clustering, and outlier removal

### **Business Impact Categories**
The model predictions are categorized into actionable business ranges:

| Lead Range | Category | Business Action | Expected ROI |
|------------|----------|-----------------|--------------|
| 0-5 leads | 🔴 **Low Performance** | Review listing quality, adjust pricing | Focus on optimization |
| 6-15 leads | 🟡 **Moderate Performance** | Standard monitoring, minor adjustments | Maintain current strategy |
| 16-30 leads | 🟢 **High Performance** | Replicate success factors, scale strategy | Increase investment |
| 31+ leads | 🌟 **Exceptional Performance** | Case study analysis, premium placement | Maximum investment |

### **Model Integration Options**

#### **Option 1: Batch Prediction (Recommended for most users)**
```python
from src.models.model_trainer import ModelTrainer
import pandas as pd

# Load your vehicle listings
listings_df = pd.read_csv('your_listings.csv')

# Get predictions for all listings
trainer = ModelTrainer()
predictions = trainer.predict_batch(listings_df)

# Add predictions to your data
listings_df['predicted_leads'] = predictions
listings_df['performance_category'] = pd.cut(
    predictions, 
    bins=[0, 5, 15, 30, float('inf')], 
    labels=['Low', 'Moderate', 'High', 'Exceptional']
)
```

#### **Option 2: Real-time API Integration**
```python
from src.models.model_trainer import ModelTrainer
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)
model = ModelTrainer.load_model('complete_ml_pipeline')

@app.route('/predict', methods=['POST'])
def predict_leads():
    data = request.json
    prediction = model.predict_single(data)
    category = categorize_prediction(prediction)
    
    return jsonify({
        'predicted_leads': prediction,
        'category': category,
        'recommendations': get_recommendations(prediction, data)
    })
```
