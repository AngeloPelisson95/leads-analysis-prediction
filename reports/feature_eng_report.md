## Feature Engineering Pipeline

### 1. Feature Selection and Removal
**Dropped Features** (15 total):
Based on domain knowledge and bivariate analysis, removed features with >80% dominant class or ID-like characteristics:
- `cd_type_individual`, `cd_advertise`, `cd_client` (ID features)
- `flg_rain_sensor`, `flg_diesel`, `flg_eletrico`, `flg_benzina` (low variance flags)
- `flg_pcd`, `flg_trade_in`, `flg_armored`, `flg_factory_warranty` (rare occurrences)
- `flg_all_dealership_schedule_vehicle`, `flg_all_dealership_services` (business-specific)
- `flg_single_owner`, `priority` (low predictive value)

### 2. Flag Clustering Implementation
**Objective**: Group vehicle feature flags to create meaningful clusters based on target correlation

**Selected Flag Features**:
- `flg_gasolina` (gasoline fuel type)
- `flg_electric_locks`, `flg_electric_windows` (electrical features)
- `flg_air_conditioning`, `flg_heater` (climate control)
- `flg_rear_defogger` (visibility features)
- `flg_alarm` (security features)
- `flg_airbag`, `flg_abs` (safety features)

**Implementation**:
- Uses `FlagClusteringTransformer` with Jenks Natural Breaks algorithm
- Clusters flag combinations by their mean target value
- Creates interpretable feature groups (e.g., safety cluster, comfort cluster)

### 3. Numerical Feature Scaling Analysis
**Scaling Methods Evaluated**:
- **StandardScaler**: Z-score normalization
- **MinMaxScaler**: 0-1 range scaling  
- **RobustScaler**: Median-based scaling (robust to outliers)
- **PowerTransformer**: Yeo-Johnson transformation for normality

**Evaluation Setup**:
- Cross-validation: 5-fold KFold
- Model: Ridge Regression (α=1.0)
- Metrics: RMSE, MAE, R²

### 4. Categorical Encoding Strategies

#### High-Cardinality Features (`city`, `state`)
**Target Encoding Implementation**:
- **City Encoding**: 
  - Smoothing factor: 0.5
  - Minimum samples per leaf: 1,000
  - Handles overfitting for rare cities
- **State Encoding**:
  - Smoothing factor: 5.0  
  - Minimum samples per leaf: 500
  - More aggressive smoothing for geographic regions

**Overfitting Risk Analysis**:
- Implemented risk assessment function
- Criteria: Categories with <50 samples AND >20% deviation from global mean
- Visualization: Scatter plot of frequency vs. encoded mean

#### Alternative Encoding (One-Hot)
- **OneHotEncoder** with `min_frequency=1000`
- Handles unknown categories with 'infrequent_if_exist'
- Creates binary columns for frequent categories

## Technical Implementation Details

### Core Classes from `src/features/feature_engineering.py`

### 1. `FeatureEngineering`
- **Purpose:** General feature engineering pipeline for exploratory analysis
- **Key Method**: `create_flag_clustering_features()`
  - Groups data by flag variable combinations
  - Computes target statistics for each combination
  - Creates a `sum_flags` feature representing total flag count
- **Usage**: Exploratory analysis and feature discovery

### 2. `FlagClusteringTransformer` 
- **Purpose:** Production-ready sklearn-compatible transformer
- **Algorithm**: Jenks Natural Breaks clustering
- **Key Features:**
  - Clusters flag combinations by mean target value
  - Learns patterns from training data without target leakage
  - Robust fallback to simple binning when Jenks fails
  - Serializable for production deployment
- **Pipeline Integration**: Compatible with `sklearn.pipeline.Pipeline`

### 3. `PreprocessingFeatures`
- **Purpose:** Comprehensive end-to-end preprocessing pipeline
- **Capabilities:**
  - Missing value imputation with strategy selection
  - Multi-method numerical scaling (Standard, MinMax, Robust, Power)
  - Categorical encoding (Label, Target, OneHot)
  - Automated outlier detection and removal (IQR-based)
  - Data quality cleaning (duplicates, spurious values)
  - Location parsing (`location` → `city` + `state`)
  - Fuel type flag conversion

## Methodology & Best Practices

### Target Encoding Overfitting Prevention
1. **Smoothing Parameters**: Balances between category-specific patterns and global mean
2. **Minimum Sample Thresholds**: Prevents encoding based on insufficient data
3. **Cross-Validation Aware**: Compatible with CV frameworks to prevent data leakage
4. **Risk Assessment**: Automated detection of high-risk categories

### Flag Clustering Rationale
- **Problem**: Individual flags may have weak predictive power
- **Solution**: Group related flags into meaningful clusters
- **Benefit**: Reduces dimensionality while preserving semantic meaning
- **Example**: Safety cluster (airbag + ABS), Comfort cluster (AC + electric features)

### Scaling Strategy Selection
- **Evaluation Framework**: Cross-validated comparison across multiple metrics
- **Model-Agnostic**: Tested with Ridge regression for unbiased comparison
- **Robust Options**: Multiple scalers handle different data distributions

## Key Findings & Recommendations

### 1. Feature Reduction Impact
- Removed 15 low-value features (31% reduction)
- Maintained prediction quality while improving model interpretability
- Reduced computational overhead and overfitting risk

### 2. Categorical Encoding Performance
- Target encoding superior to one-hot for high-cardinality features
- Smoothing parameters critical for preventing overfitting
- Geographic features (city/state) benefit from aggressive smoothing

### 3. Flag Engineering Success
- Flag clustering creates interpretable feature groups
- Jenks algorithm effectively captures non-linear target relationships
- Fallback mechanisms ensure robustness in production

### 4. Scaling Requirements
- Numerical features span different scales (views vs. vehicle price)
- StandardScaler generally optimal for linear models
- RobustScaler recommended for outlier-prone features
