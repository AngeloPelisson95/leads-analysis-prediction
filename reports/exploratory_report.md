- **Purpose**: Initial data exploration and understanding
- **Content**: 
  - Data loading and basic statistics
  - Missing values analysis
  - Target variable distribution
  - Column categorization
- **Output**: Clean data understanding and initial insights
- **Insights**:
  - **Missing Values**: The raw data contains six columns with missing values. The `vl_market` column has 12.78% missing values.
  - **Columns**: There are 21 flag columns, 6 code columns, 2 numeric columns, and 10 columns classified as "other" on initial review.
  - **Target**: The target column `leads` represents the number of leads generated by each advertisement. 21.8% of advertisements have zero leads, while 48% have at least one lead.
  - **Features**:
    - `transmission_type` has two dominant classes: *manual* (55%) and *automatico* (43%).
    - `fuel_type` has two dominant classes: *gasolina e alcool* (72.3%) and *gasolina* (21.2%).
    - `priority` is dominated by class 3 (low priority), which accounts for 77.6% of advertisements.
    - `cd_type_inidividual` is mostly "Individual," representing 85% of advertisements.
    - `flg_air_conditioning`: The positive class represents 85% of the dataset.

#### üßπ [02_data_cleaning.ipynb](./exploratory/02_data_cleaning.ipynb)
- **Purpose**: Data preprocessing and cleaning
- **Content**:
  - Geographic data splitting (city_state ‚Üí city + state)
  - Flag column standardization
  - Fuel type expansion into binary flags
  - Duplicate removal and data validation
  - Target variable engineering
- **Output**: `../../data/processed/cleaned_data.csv`
- **Insights**:
  - After splitting the `city_state` column, we found 28 unique states and 959 unique cities.
  - Flag columns were standardized to integer values: 'S' and 'Y' were replaced with 1, and 'N' with 0. There are 21 flag columns. This approach provides general information about the state and reduces column granularity.
  - The `fuel_type` column originally contained 11 classes with overlapping strings such as *gasolina* and *alcool*. We split these strings and extracted unique values, reducing to 6 classes and creating 6 new flag columns. As a result, 94% of advertisements have `gasolina` as a fuel type and 73% have `alcool`.
  - A new flag column (`flg_leads`) was created to indicate whether an advertisement had at least one lead. 78% of advertisements have leads.
  - Outlier and skewness analysis revealed some extremely high values that may contaminate the dataset and introduce bias. We removed values above the 99th percentile of feature distributions to address this. Also we noted that columns `vl_advertise`, `km_vehicle` had higher values which not reflects reality, like 2 million kilometers of use or advertise value of 40 million. 


#### üîç [03_exploratory_analysis.ipynb](./exploratory/03_exploratory_analysis.ipynb)
- **Purpose**: Deep statistical analysis and pattern discovery
- **Content**:
  - Correlation analysis and feature relationships
  - Distribution analysis and skewness detection
  - Outlier detection and treatment
  - Categorical feature classification
  - Bivariate analysis with target variable
- **Output**: Statistical insights and feature recommendations
- **Insights**
  - **Feature categorization**: The goal is to separate categorical and numerical columns to better understand their relationships, as each type requires different analytical approaches.
    - We first analyzed the correlation between numerical features and the target variable (`leads`). No strong linear correlation was found, except for `phone_clicks`, which showed some relevant association with `leads`. It‚Äôs important to note that low correlation does not imply low importance‚Äîrather, it indicates a lack of linear relationship. Therefore, tree-based models may be a good choice for predicting whether an advertisement will generate leads.
    - Statistical summaries and distribution analyses for numerical features (`leads`, `views`, `phone_clicks`) reveal that most ads have low counts for these metrics. Both market and advertised values are concentrated in lower ranges; higher values skew the averages, and expensive ads are rare. The number of photos and doors are concentrated in specific values, suggesting these can be treated as categorical features.
    - **What do advertisements with more leads have in common?**
      - The objective was to identify combinations of flag features associated with higher lead counts.
      - Filtering for the top 20 feature combinations by lead count showed that `flg_gasolina`, `flg_electric_locks`, `flg_air_conditioning`, `flg_electric_windows`, `flg_rear_defogger`, `flg_heater`, `flg_alarm`, `flg_airbag`, and `flg_abs` are present in up to 75% of these combinations.
      - Further analysis revealed that 5.6% of all leads come from ads with only `flg_gasolina` positive, 40% from ads with all the features above, and another 5% from ads missing only `flg_alarm`. In total, 50% of all leads are associated with these feature combinations.
    - **Categorical feature classification and bivariate analysis**
      - We examined the distribution and types of categorical features to inform modeling strategies.
      - Many binary features have dominant classes representing over 80% of the distribution.
      - Some features have high cardinality and will require specialized encoding, to be validated in future steps.
      - 99% of ads do not have *benzina* as a fuel type and are not configured for individuals with disabilities (`flg_pcd`).
      - 47% of leads are concentrated in the state of SP, with 18.7% from S√£o Paulo city and 5% from Rio de Janeiro.
    - **Do clients with more ads receive more leads?**
      - Correlation analysis shows only a weak linear relationship between the number of ads and leads, confirming that having more ads does not necessarily result in more leads.
    - The correlation analysis show us that is a weak linear relationship between this features. Confirming that high number of adds not represent more leads.
    - Show hiugh variance in leads numbers and what lead us to conclude that strategy and quality for the advertises are more relevant.
  - **Advertises with vl_market (market value) lower then vl_advertise (advertise value) have less leads?**
    - This afirmation is true, advertises that have values lower then market value have 3 times more leads.

  1. üìà NUMERICAL FEATURES:
    - Focus on top performers: phone_clicks, km_vehicle, n_doors
    - Apply log transformation to skewed features
    - Consider binning for better interpretability
    - Create interaction features between top performers

  2. üè∑Ô∏è CATEGORICAL FEATURES:
    - Prioritize: cd_type_individual, zip_2dig, flg_armored
    - Use target encoding for high cardinality features
    - Group rare categories into 'Other'
    - Consider feature combinations for flag variables
